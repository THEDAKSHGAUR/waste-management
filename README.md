  Residents can schedule waste pickups through an easy-to-use interface.  

- **Real-Time Tracking:**  
  Track the status of waste collection and pickup schedules.  

- **Admin Dashboard:**  
  Manage user requests, monitor collection activities, and generate reports.  

- **Interactive Maps:**  
  View collection routes and optimize resource allocation.  

- **Notifications:**  
  Automated alerts and reminders for upcoming pickups and missed collections.  

- **Data Analytics:**  
  Insights into waste collection patterns and volumes to support decision-making.
